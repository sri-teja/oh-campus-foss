<h3 class="media-heading"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> A curriculum built to engage students.</h3>
<p>Our curriculum covers the practical skills students need to contribute to open source projects, such as using version control, issue trackers, and IRC. It creates connections between students and open source professionals who can explain how the community and culture works. And it gives students the opportunity to make real contributions to active open source projects - all in a single day!</p>
<p>All of our curriculum materials are online, and most activities have instructor walkthroughs and/or screencasts as well. <a href="https://openhatch.org/wiki/Open_Source_Comes_to_Campus/Curriculum">Take a look</a> at what we offer. We're happy to help you adjust the curriculum to meet your needs, and do trainings for any activities or sections you don't feel comfortable with.</p>

<p>We believe in the power of open source to make the world a better place. We also believe that open source needs a broad and diverse group of contributors and community members to do so.

We're commited to these goals, as well as to continuous improvement, and we hope you'll join us in our efforts.
